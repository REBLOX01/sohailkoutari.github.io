Project. a personnal project created by Sohail koutari 

I created this study project, through the visual studio

code program, and also through my knowledge about programming,

I built this personal website using two basic languages, HTML 

and CSS, where the percentage of HTML on the site is 51.3%, and 

as for CSS, its percentage on the site is 48.7%.

The pages of the site consist of 4 pages, each page

contains its own content, and each introductory content

about itself in addition to some knowledge, and also some 

free images and icons taken from some websites such as 

fontawesome and some images from Google Images were used.
